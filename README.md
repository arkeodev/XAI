# Explainable AI (XAI) Notebook Repository

## Introduction

This repository hosts "XAI.ipynb", a Jupyter notebook dedicated to exploring and implementing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. XAI aims to make the outputs of machine learning models understandable to humans, bridging the gap between high accuracy and interpretability. As AI systems take on more critical roles in our lives, the transparency and understandability of these systems become paramount for trust, compliance, debugging, ethical considerations, and collaborative decision-making.

## What is Explainable AI?

Explainable AI refers to methods and techniques in artificial intelligence that provide insights into the decision-making processes of machine learning models. Unlike traditional 'black box' approaches, XAI focuses on making AI systems transparent, interpretable, and understandable to humans. This is crucial for ensuring accountability, fairness, and trustworthiness in AI applications, particularly in sensitive and high-stakes areas such as healthcare, finance, and legal systems.

## Repository Contents

- **XAI.ipynb**: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that covers various aspects and techniques of Explainable AI. The notebook includes:
  - An introduction to the importance of explainability in AI.
  - A discussion on the balance between model accuracy and interpretability.
  - An exploration of interpretability scopes, including global and local interpretability.
  - Demonstrations of model-agnostic and model-specific explainability tools.
  - Implementation and examples of key XAI techniques such as LIME, SHAP, Counterfactual Explanations.
  - Visual and interactive demos showcasing AI model explanations.
- **Layerwise Relevance Propogation (LRP)**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the Layerwise Relevance Propogation (LRP) technique for explaining AI models.

## Coming Soon
